- super_editor
- Rust
- flutter_rust_bridge
- highlight

## Quick Start 🚀

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (stable)
- Rust toolchain

### Install & Run
1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lumiwrite.git
   cd lumiwrite
   ```
2. Install Flutter dependencies
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Generate Rust bindings (when needed)
   If you modify or rebuild `native/`, regenerate Dart bindings:
   ```bash
   flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate
   ```
4. Run
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### App Icon 🎨
Place your icon PNG at the project root as `app.png`, and make sure
`flutter_launcher_icons.image_path` in `pubspec.yaml` points to it.

Generate icons:
```bash
flutter pub get
dart run flutter_launcher_icons
```

Rebuild Windows:
```bash
flutter build windows --release
```

### Portable Package (Recommended) 📦
The portable build output is located at `build/windows/x64/runner/Release/`.
Zip the whole directory for distribution.

One-click packaging script:
```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File installer\package_portable.ps1
```

Outputs:
- `dist/LumiWrite_Portable/` (ready to run)
- `dist/LumiWrite_Portable.zip` (ready to share)

### File Association Scripts (.md / .markdown) 🧷
The portable package includes two scripts:
- `register_md.ps1`: associate `.md/.markdown` with `LumiWrite.exe`
- `unregister_md.ps1`: remove the association

Run from the same folder as `LumiWrite.exe`:
```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\register_md.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\unregister_md.ps1
```

## Hotkey Configuration ⌨️
Default hotkeys:
- Ctrl+Z: Undo
- Ctrl+Y: Redo
- Ctrl+S: Save
- Ctrl+O: Open file
- Ctrl+Shift+O: Open folder

You can edit `hotkeys.json` in the project root, for example:
```json
{
  "undo": "Ctrl+Z",
  "redo": "Ctrl+Y",
  "save": "Ctrl+S",
  "openFile": "Ctrl+O",
  "openFolder": "Ctrl+Shift+O"
}
```
Leave a value empty to disable that hotkey.
